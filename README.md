# INCAS Unreal Engine Realism Training Project

This repository contains files from a project I created for an in-depth study on realism using Unreal Engine. I was selected to participate in this limited free training program provided by INCAS in Germany, which focused on advanced techniques for creating realistic 3D environments and animations.

## Description

This project demonstrates my ability to:

*   Use Unreal Engine to create realistic 3D environments.
*   Apply advanced techniques for lighting, textures, modeling, and animation.
*   Work within the structure of a large game engine.
*  Apply technical skills to generate high-quality digital content.

This project highlights the following aspects:

*   **Realism Focus:** The main goal was to achieve a high level of realism in the virtual environment.
*   **Advanced Techniques:** The training focused on how to combine lighting, textures, and modeling to generate high-quality content.
*   **Unreal Engine:** The project is built within the Unreal Engine.

## How to Use

1.  **Download the Project:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    ```
2.  **Open with Unreal Engine:** Open the project using the Unreal Engine editor.

## Important Notes

*   This project was created for a training program, and reflects the skills I acquired during it.
*   The project might require a specific version of the Unreal Engine editor to be opened correctly.
*   This project is being shared as is for educational and illustrative purposes.

## About Me

This project showcases one of the many different areas that I'm currently exploring. Besides being passionate about Computer Science and AI, I am also very interested in the world of design and how both can work together.
